# ðŸš€ Scratchpad for the typescript based reimplementation of jsf js

This project is a work in progress for a typescript based 
reimplementation of jsf.js

The main goal is maintainability. It omits legacy browsers
with Edge being the baseline for the moment
(probably extended soon to IE11)

It uses functional constructs on micro scale
to keep the maintainability and uses 
my own monadish project as core framework base.
